# Functional Style Checker

## Overview
This script analyzes Python source files for style compliance and generates a detailed report. The checks include:
- **File Structure**: Total lines of code, imported packages, classes, and functions.
- **DocStrings**: Extracts and lists DocStrings for classes, methods, and functions.
- **Type Annotation Check**: Lists functions and methods missing type annotations.
- **Naming Convention Check**: Identifies non-compliant class and function names.

---

## Features
1. **File Structure**:
   - Counts total lines of code.
   - Lists imported packages.
   - Lists all classes (excluding methods) and top-level functions.

2. **DocStrings**:
   - Extracts DocStrings for classes, methods, and functions.
   - Reports "DocString not found" if missing.

3. **Type Annotation Check**:
   - Lists functions and methods that lack type annotations.
   - Confirms if all annotations are present.

4. **Naming Convention Check**:
   - Identifies classes not in CamelCase style.
   - Identifies functions/methods not in snake_case style.
   - Provides a summary of compliance.

## Usage
1. Place the Python file to be analyzed in the same directory or provide its full path.
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python functional_style_checker.py
   ```
3. Input the Python file path when prompted:
   ```plaintext
   Enter the Python file path: sample_files/sample.py
   ```
4. The script will generate a report file in the same directory as the input file, named `style_report_{Python File Name}.txt`.

---

## Example Output
The following is an example of the report generated by the script for the file `sample.py`:

```plaintext
File Structure
Total lines: 22

Imports
import os
import sys

Classes
CompliantClass
Noncompliantclass

Functions
compliant_function
nonCompliantFunction

DocStrings
CompliantClass: """This is a sample class with a compliant name."""
compliant_method: """A method with proper naming and type annotations."""
non_compliantMethod: DocString not found
Noncompliantclass: """This class has a non-compliant name."""
compliant_method: """A properly named method with type annotations."""
compliant_function: """A top-level function with proper naming and annotations."""
nonCompliantFunction: DocString not found

Type Annotation Check
non_compliantMethod
nonCompliantFunction

Naming Convention Check
Non-Compliant Classes
Noncompliantclass

Non-Compliant Functions
nonCompliantFunction
```

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required.

---

## Error Handling
1. If the file is not found, the script will print a clear error message.
2. Handles empty or improperly formatted Python files gracefully.

---

## Additional Notes
- The script adheres to functional programming principles, ensuring modular, reusable, and stateless functions.
- Any feedback issues from Assignment 1, such as method exclusion from classes and correct regex handling, have been fixed.
- A final summary is included in the report to indicate overall compliance with naming conventions and type annotations.
